## Professionally

### What I do

I am a designer and builder of internet things.

Sometimes that means making websites. Sometimes that means designing apps. I can get rather technical (I love rails and ember) but I prefer to focus on usability, user experience, and aesthetics.

I love bringing my technical background to designing User Interfaces, and just building things in general.

### Who I like to work with

I’m especially fond of working with anyone who wants to make the world a better place.

Also, I love working with small businesses.

## Personally

I’m a disciple of Jesus Christ. Although I’ve been a Christian most of my life, really getting to know Jesus has been utterly fulfilling and transformative.

This world may be hard and confusing sometimes, but His love and mercy will endure forever.

### Other Stuff

You’re more likely to find me drawing or reading that watching sports or reality shows. But I do appreciate a good many movies.

I enjoy red meat, loud music, lifting weights, and being outside, and loving my family.

## Want to work with me?

I am currently employed, but I am accepting speaking gigs and freelance jobs. Feel free to [contact me](mailto:ryanlabouve.com@gmail.com) for more information.
