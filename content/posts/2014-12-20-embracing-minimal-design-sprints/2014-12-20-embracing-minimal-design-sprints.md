> “Weeks of programming can save you hours of planning” —Unknown

We are all drunk with power. We can take our dreams and ideas and turn them into apps and websites.

It’s so tempting to dive in and start coding with no strategy or plan.

As our team takes on more projects and our side-projects begin to turn into platforms, we’ve had to evolve our process.

### Design Sprints

We now use design sprints. No weeks of research or teams of analysts required. Just everyone putting their heads together and going through a process that we know works. We communicate and validate our ideas first. This gives us **one** clear direction before we dive in to development.

We first read about design sprints at [ThoughtBot](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/the-product-design-sprint), but the concept originates from [Google Ventures](http://www.gv.com/lib/the-product-design-sprint-a-five-day-recipe-for-startups).

## Minimal Design Sprints

*   Small Teams (i.e. 1–3)
*   One Day Sprint

On small teams everyone develops and everyone designs. There is no research team or UX team. Ideas must achieve rapid validation, and get to development.

That why we do a **minimal design sprint**. It’s fast. For small projects this could be a few hours. For most projects this would be 1 or 2 days max.

## 01\. Understand

*   **Deliverables:** Project Brief

This is where we go from “Let’s build a timer app” to “let’s build a workout timer for people using iPhones to do the [7-minute workout](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/the-scientific-7-minute-workout/)”

**Why** are we making this, **who** are we making this for, **what problem** are we solving, and **when** are we launching.

Go into some detail, but keep it brief.

    # Consider an Elevator Pitch: https://agilewarrior.wordpress.com/2010/11/06/the-agile-inception-deck

    For [target customer]
    Who [Statement of Need or opportunity]
    the [Product Name]
    is a [product category]
    that [key benefit/reason to buy]
    unlike [competition]
    our product [statement of primary differentiation]

## 02\. Individual Brainstorming

*   **Deliverables:** Lots of possible solutions

We’ll individually map our way through the app; how it would make sense to us. This should be done in whatever tools are most comfortable for the individual, as long as they are: lo-fi, quick, and user-focused.

Our goal here is collect potential narratives of how the app/website/project should work.

Some possible techniques:

It’s important to emphasize that the goal here is for _individuals_ to brainstorm. Not to group brainstorm.

## 03\. Group Convergence

*   **Deliverables:** UI Flows and Storyboards

> Best ideas win. Doesn’t matter if its design from your lead UX designer, an engineer, or your Grandma

The goal here is to throw out all but the best ideas.

This is ideally a democratic process, but it will look different for each group. If there are multiple good options, awesome. Take each one of them to prototype.

## 04\. Prototype

*   **Deliverables:** “Goldilocks” fidelity prototypes

We’re going for “goldilocks level fidelity”; just good enough to suspend disbelief.

Tools:

*   [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) + [a ui kit](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=sketch%20ui%20kit)
*   Keynote + [Keynotopia](http://keynotopia.com/)
*   [Pen, Paper, and Sharpies](http://www.slideshare.net/pboersma/good-design-faster-at-ux-sofia) (or [this](http://www.slideshare.net/pubsmith/sketching-interfaces-workshop-interactions12-dublin?related=1))
*   [Bootstrap HTML Prototype](http://getbootstrap.com/)
*   [Balsamic](http://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/)

## 05\. Validate

*   **Deliverables:** The Way Forward

Test cheap and fast. Test with moms and dads, significant other, boy friends, girl friends… whoever will give some feedback.

Keep in mind, you’re not necessarily asking them what to do. You’re trying to measure the potential success of your ideas.

> If I would have asked people what they wanted, they would have said “a father horse” —Henry Ford

How can we measure an idea’s success? From GV’s [HEART framework](http://www.gv.com/lib/how-to-choose-the-right-ux-metrics-for-your-product)— Happiness, Engagement, Adoption, Retention, Task Success— we can really focus on a) task success and b) engagement.

Out of testing you should have a direction to go. Sometimes it’s exactly what you thought. Other times you will be surprised. And sometimes you’ll end up back to the drawing board— and that’s ok.
