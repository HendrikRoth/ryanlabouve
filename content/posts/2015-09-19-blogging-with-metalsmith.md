During the interview for my last job, I was asked what my blogging platform was.

It was wordpress.

I joked for this not to be held against me. Time to change anyways.

* Simple (not to be confused with easy)
* Static Site
* Version Controlled
* Unnecessarily Configurable

And to make some things _simpler_, I wanted it to be a seamless transition of
my current site to a new one.


I'd still want to do a blag thing eventually
