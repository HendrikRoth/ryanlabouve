*   Setting up Gulp
*   Separate authoring stylesheets from production stylesheets
*   Automating Some Basic SASS things

I [recently evangelized](http://ryanlabouve.com/sophisticating-your-css/) using a task runner as a necessity in your front-end workflow.

The focus of this series it to show you, step by step, how to start working with task runners (in our case, gulp).

We are going to follow through the whole process, just like I was writing it from scratch.

## Prerequisites

This may seem technical if you have limited experience with terminal, but I’ve made it as easy as possible to follow along.

Also, if you prefer a different preprocessor, like Less or Stylus, the setup is very similar. You’ll just have to look at [gulp-less](https://github.com/plus3network/gulp-less) or [gulp-stylus](https://github.com/stevelacy/gulp-stylus) when I start talking about sass.

*   [Install SASS](http://sass-lang.com/install)
*   [Install Node](http://nodejs.org/)
*   Have a basic understanding of [terminal](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-command-line-is-your-best-friend--net-30362)

## What is Gulp

Gulp is simply a way to take the code we author and transform it with other programs. This can allow us to do everything from minification to code linting.

### Streams

All we are doing with gulp is loading up a series of files into a data stream, passing that stream through different programs… from input to output, modifying the stream as we go to suit our goals.

### The Five Big Functions

There’s not a lot to Gulp:

*   **gulp.task(name, fn)** registers a task
*   **gulp.run(tasks…)** runs tasks
*   **gulp.watch(glob,fn)** runs tasks when files change
*   **gulp.src(glob)** turns your files into streams
*   **gulp.dest(folder)** writes stream to file system

That’s it. Now let’s write some gulp.

## Setting up Project

I’ve set up some basic html, css, and javascript if you want to follow along: [ryanlabouve/gulp-for-css, v0.1](https://github.com/ryanlabouve/gulp-for-css/releases/tag/v0.1). Or feel free to try along with one of your own projects.

First, `cd` into the root of the project directory, initialize npm, and install gulp.

    npm init
    npm install --save-dev gulp
    npm install --save-dev gulp-util

This has generated a basic package.json file, and added gulp and gulp-util as dependencies.

Note that the `--save-dev` actually adds our dependencies to the `package.json` file.

## Gulpfile

Now let’s work on the our `gulpfile.js`.

    touch gulpfile.js

Require gulp, setup a default task, and then run `gulp` to make sure everything’s setup.

    // gulpfile.js

    var gulp = require('gulp');
    var gutil = require('gulp-util');

    gulp.task('default', function() {
        gutil.log("Running Gulp!");
    });

If we run `gulp` in our terminal we will see “Runing gulp!”.

## Server

Now let’s setup a local server for our project.

This will make several things easier (like connecting to external services and resources).

    npm install gulp-connect --save-dev

For our gulpfile we’ll add new new task called `connnect` that uses [gulp-connect](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-connect) to start a server and add the new `connect` to run in our `default` task.

Again, for every plugin, we’ll have to require it at the top so we can use it in our gulpfile `var connect = require('gulp-connect');`… and then later `connect.server`…

    // gulpfile.js
    // requires...
    var connect = require('gulp-connect');

    gulp.task('connect', function() {
        connect.server({
            port: 8989,
            livereload: true
        });
    });

    gulp.task('default', ['connect']);

Now when we run `gulp`, and then navigate to **http://localhost:8989** we see our project running in the browser.

Please note, on all of the gulp plugins I’m using I’ll link to the [documentation](https://github.com/avevlad/gulp-connect), which will have further instructions on how to customize how we run the plugins.

[ryanlabouve/gulp-for-css, v0.3](https://github.com/ryanlabouve/gulp-for-css/releases/tag/v0.3)

## SASS

Let’s get SASS wired up now.

We’re going to be using the [gulp-ruby-sass](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-ruby-sass/tree/rw/1.0) plugin to compile our SASS.

**!important** We are actually going to run an alpha version of the sass plugin. If you want to read more about that, [here you go](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-ruby-sass/pull/137).

**!important** We are also going to turn on sourcemaps for our sass while we are here. It makes [debugging sass](http://snugug.com/musings/debugging-sass-source-maps) much easier.

`npm install --save-dev gulp-ruby-sass@1.0.0-alpha`  
`npm install gulp-sourcemaps --save-dev`

Now I’m going to move all of the existing `/css` into `/scss` and changing the extension to `.scss`. (I’ll add a few sass variables too, so we can show the compiler is working).

Now, let’s add a gulp task and configure it to work:

We’ll require `gulp-ruby-sass`, make a new task called `sass`,

    // gulpfile.js
    //... requires
    var sass = require('gulp-ruby-sass');
    var sourcemaps = require('gulp-sourcemaps');

    gulp.task('sass', function() {
        return sass('scss/app.scss', {
            'sourcemap': true,
            'style': 'expanded',
            'lineNumbers': true
        })
        .pipe(sourcemaps.write())
        .pipe(gulp.dest('css'));
    });

    //... rest of the tasks

Now when we run `gulp sass` and check the `/css` directory we see that our sass has compiled successfully.

**!imoprtant** Note that we can pass any source into for the sass function to process and any destination into `gulp.dest` for it to write out to. Try changing to `pipe(gulp.dest('dist/css'));` and see how you can mold gulp to store your projects however suits you.

## Tying it All Together with Watch

Currently we have to `gulp sass` after every change we made.

Instead, let’s have our server running and our sass compiling at the same time, as well as livereload-ing our pages every time we make a change

### gulp.watch + livereload

The watch task is really easy. We are simply watching a glob of file (i.e. ‘*_/_.scss’, or, everything in the scss folder) for a change, and then running a task if we detect a change.

    gulp.task('watch', function() {
        gulp.watch('**/*.scss', ['sass']);
    });

Next we’ll expand our default task to: run `sass` immediately when we start gulp, start the local server with `connect`, and finally set gulp to keep `watch`ing for changes.

    gulp.task('default', ['sass', 'connect', 'watch]);

Finally, we’ll add one line to the end of our `sass` task to tell livereload to trigger after we run `sass`.

    .pipe(connect.reload());

### The Full Gulpfile

Here’s the full gulpfile, in all of its glory!

[ryanlabouve/gulp-for-css,v5.0](https://github.com/ryanlabouve/gulp-for-css/releases/tag/v0.5)

    // gulpfile.js
    var gulp = require('gulp');
    var gutil = require('gulp-util');
    var connect = require('gulp-connect');
    var sass = require('gulp-ruby-sass');
    var sourcemaps = require('gulp-sourcemaps');

    gulp.task('sass', function() {
        return sass('scss/app.scss', {
            'sourcemap': true,
            'style': 'expanded',
            'lineNumbers': true
        })
        .pipe(sourcemaps.write())
        .pipe(gulp.dest('css'))
        .pipe(connect.reload());
    });

    gulp.task('connect', function() {
        connect.server({
            port: 8989,
            livereload: true
        });
    });

    gulp.task('watch', function() {
        gulp.watch('**/*.scss', ['sass']);
    });

    gulp.task('default', ['sass', 'connect', 'watch']);

Sweet! Let’s review what we’ve done

*   Compile SASS on the Fly
*   Live reload changes
*   Setup local server to run project

### Next Time

Next time, in part two, we’ll look at how to have different stylesheet builds for development stylesheets and production stylesheets.
