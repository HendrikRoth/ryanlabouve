At some point, everyone wants to write a post explaining their way of doing things. At some other more painful point, there comes a time when it is necessary to get a bunch of folks (developers, designer, and business people) to accomplish a set of tasks... which ultimately requires a good process.

Full disclaimer: this is not where we started! We learned many hard lessons that finally brought us to here.

## The Tools

* Hangouts
* Slack
* Github
* JIRA
* Basecamp

## The Process

(Our process is cyclical... which makes it hard to find the right point to dive in. So I'm just going to start with *the sprint*)

### The Sprint

Two week sprints.
Fulltimers and contractors.
Product Governors pick the general horde of tasks
Lead Devs point up
Everyone aims for xx points

### The Standup

### Feature Talk

### Backlog Meeting

### QA Reckoning

### Release Party

### Sprint Planning Meeting

### Tactical Support
